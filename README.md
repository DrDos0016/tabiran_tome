The Tabiran Tome is a Django powered website to help members of the storytelling group [Tales of Tabira](http://talesoftabira.deviantart.com/) track their teams and group content.

## Installation

Running a local copy requires an installation of Django >= 1.8.4, a compatible database backend, and a developer key for [DeviantArt's API](https://www.deviantart.com/developers/).

Additionally, sprites of Pok√©mon used on the site can be pulled from [pokedex-media](http://git.veekun.com/pokedex-media.git).
